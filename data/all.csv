 p value gives the magintude of strength for rejecting null ,0
 so that means jab not equal to hoga two tailed graph hoga and > hoga to one tailed graph hoga ,0
 sir independent two sample ,0
 ha bich me stop hogya tha ,0
 chal raha hai ,0
 abhi aa rahi hai ,0
 degree of freedom ,0

 i ve read that no more than 4000iu of vitamin d should be taken daily ,0
 the content on your channel has been highly informative i live in he uk but uk gov nhs web site does not provide the same detail they seem to be re active your content seems more proactive ,0
 ivermectin can bind up the virus as well ,0
 this doesn t feel live ,0

 lmao you guys think he is taking a vaccine ,0
 it s not live ,0
 like ivermectin lol ,0
 i take 10k iu daily but i also get my levels checked ,0
 please see vitamin d dosing from previous episodes ,0

 at girlgeniusnyc recommendations i ve seen is 2000 iu s a day but check with your doctor ,0
 4000 iu a vitamin d3 a day recommended ,0
 4k iu doesn t cover everyone genetics and many other factors can play a part get the levels checked ,0
 at peter larsson i m one of few people that have got very sick from sulphoraphane (broccomax) supplements ,0
 sulforaphane is good for many thing ,0
 i had cardiac problems from overdose of vitamin d ,0
 your dosing depends on your blood level and titration ,0
 see your physician regarding vitamin d medcram is wonderful resource see your physician ,0
 check with your doctor about vitamin d i found out that i had a deficiency but only through blood testing ,0
 at monika l then link to a webpage saying that ,0
 vitamin d kicked my covid in 2 days ,0
 at monika l good to hear ,0
 this should be on the news every day ,0
 ivermectin will never be used as it doesn t make anyone any money ,0
 1 for ivm ,0
 dont take 1 000 000 iu s ,0
 i took 4000 ui for 3 days each day ,0
 nobody in the chat should be giving medical advice not ethical ,0
 at peter larsson i was taking less than recommended dose and still getting a bad reaction ,0
 sounds like the vitamin d hammer ,0
 vitd needs fat to be absorbed ,0
 i had tachicardia from the first dose ,0
 yeah i think i m going to stick with my ivermectin zinc and d3 thank you ,0
 we got the sun in the caribbean and we get free vit d ,0
 we all have brains research research for yourselves don t be a lemming ,0
 vitamin d supplements usually have olive oil in the capsule for absorbtion ,0
 i want people with severe disease to be screen for nutrient deficiencies and that be considered a comorbidity ,0
 check the vitamin d levels in your blood and adjust your dosage you need to get to 50 ng and ml ,0
 vit k2 mk 7 ,0
 ivermectin for the win ,0
 i woke up up with pulse of 133 next day ,0
 at landon wiebe honesly i eat it 1 year now and never feel so good ,0
 at landon wiebe look at dr rhonda patric ,0
 at doremon2006 it takes vit d several days to be converted to active form though 4000 iu a day should be okay for most people but 3 times a day sounds excessive blood test is best way to know ,0
 our medical professionals have no idea we are in new territory here and have to act on our own judgments ,0
 i have h63d so iron overload feeds all pathogens and destroys the myelin sheathing in brain it leads to alzh diabetes glucose dysregulation glutamic acid excitotoxin ugh im 72 i dobt ,0
 oh look at that he even says don t go out and do this on your own ,0
 my elder sister took all of this and she had only mild covid ,0
 just buy some mayo and spread it on a clinic mayo clinic ,0
 i also recommend vitamin c as well as zinc i ve been taking that throughout my life daily ,0
 quercetin found in onions ,0
 i take d3 k2 zinc vitamin c quercetin is expensive i can t afford it apparently it enables zinc more ,0
 d vit sulforaphane moringa and oliv oil hard core slightly smiling face ,0
 at peter larsson i follow her closely i even ran my 23andme dna test data through her website got some interested gentic info on vitamin d and telomere lengths ,0
 artemisia killer ,0
 quercitin is in capers ,0
 at debbie b great minds think alike winking face ,0
 zinc 50 mg (elemental zinc ) is a better dose ,0
 leronlimab (ll) is another mab that will report phase iii results in a couple of weeks being given to severe and critical patients ,0
 sleep medicine certified ,0
 i take vitamin d3 as a supplement and 2 big vitamin c supplements to prepare for covid its expensive but its better than jacking your body with 50 000 units in one shot sheesh ,0
 yep exactly ,0
 med students volunteered to get the virus in their noses ,0
 that is dr pierre kory ,0
 lmao im doing that now at 12 midnight ,0
 at debbie b i feel i have no choice but i have at least managed to half my dose ,0
 specifically cyp3a4 pathway ,0
 haven t had a good night s sleep in years ,0
 give the steam a like folks ,0
 melatonin people ,0
 avoid caffeine it suppresses melatonin production ,0
 melatonin is banned in the uk crazy ,0
 i take 9mg ,0
 flue vaccine don t work my sister get vaccine every year and get 3 times flue a year and i got a flue in 2o18 same simtomes as covid and that was it till now ,0
 selenium and copper balance w zinc ,0
 s u l f o r a p h a n e ,0
 henrik correct but w all these blue light screens etc it s lacking ,0
 just got tested positive today startin the year off great ,0
 zinc should only be 50 mg a day for a normal healthy person ,0
 at denisegaur i exaggerate a little but basically because it is not a drug nor a vitamin nor a mineral it can t be legalized ,0
 4000 ius vitamin d is too low dr tenpenny recommends much higher ,0
 so it s completely unavailable in the uk melatonin ,0
 ivermectin oops ,0
 suddenly people here become doctors ,0
 i think i have been taking waay to much zinc ,0
 you can buy melatonin at the grocery store in the us ,0
 taking zicam and zinc and c lonzenges a couple times a day my boyfriend has covid i didnt want to catch it ,0
 makes sense innate system is first to respond adaptive system takes weeks to generate appropriate antibodies ,0
 looks at the australia number they do have ppl taking ive rme ctin and they have very low numbers ,0
 at joshua tazie not elemental zinc it should be lower than that too a max of 40mg it s a labelling issue 50 mg zinc citrate provides about 16mg elemental zinc ,0
 nk normal ,0
 at drjohn thanks ,0
 at james smith i take 12 cans of larger for 3 months and seems to have a positive outcome ,0
 ivermectin dont avoid discussing this ,0
 at ima ok haha i m already trying this strategy right now grinning face ,0
 we farmers have a lot of ivermectin laying around for de worming cattle lol ,0
 dr campbell and dr seheult are releasing their joint show on monday (jan 4) ,0
 fda cdc part of med tyranny ,0
 at oseheult1 thanks ,0
 michael yeadon has a saner view than dr bedwetter campbell ,0
 i will take all the vaccines i will pay to get it more quickly ,0
 interceptor that s because mast cells are overactive w asthma part of the innate arm ,0
 at james smith face with tears of joy ,0
 at tester123532456 we have a wide choice of vaccines no way there is collusion on a global scale between countries that don t trust each other yet each produce a vaccine i trust ,0
 at tester123532456 exactly ,0
 my guy ended up pneumonia got treated with oral steroids and antibiotics but still have chest pain after the treatment i have him do the incentive spirometer and other deep breathing exercises ,0
 medcram is awesome ,0
 dosages have to be adjusted though at james smith ,0
 leave a like for the doc ,0
 yes don t swallow the entire horse dose lol ,0
 at denisegaur aah ok thank you ,0
 but budesonide etc nebulized after the inflammatory phase starts looks to help ,0
 my herbal tea has the same effect sweating and after 1 2 cups viral infection seems to be blocked ,0
 mild exercise would increase your core temperature also ,0
 they can t make money from this so they will kill it ,0
 steam rooms that y they shut gyms dr ,0
 look up coleys toxins ,0
 in the caribbean one island we had last year more death in cancer then any year and covid death was 45 in 120000 people ,0
 covid is so dumb ,0
 red light therapy helps also mitochondrial stimulator ,0
 drs have been using hyperthermia in cancer for decades ,0
 don t mind the hot therapy its the cold bit i don t like ,0
 caribbean has lots of sunshine ,0
 at debbie b i believe so zinc depletes copper i take zinc picolinate ,0
 at denisegaur thanks ,0
 at mr fat face other wards could be empty but covid wards are full just confirm ,0
 daily air refresh and tons of uvc and hepa filters in my home ,0
 fat face the are running out of rooom for covid patients not the same as for all because they have to be isolated ,0
 you re welcome at james ,0
 my house is infiltrated and there s no way to avoid my boyfriends germs loudly crying face ,0
 i guess hot flashes don t count winking face ,0
 i m 42 thanks to videos by dr s i m now running every day for 30 mins then a cold shower i ve given up smoking and i take vit d zinc quercetin i work on front line no illness for last 12 months ,0

 at hal 9000 thumbs up ,0

 at debbie as they shouldn t be now ,0
 co poisoning gives a high spo2 reading too we used to see that in car and exhaust hosepipe suicide attempts ( iw as a paramedic) ,0
 good advice ,0
 i take 2000 iu vit d daily great immune system booster ,0
 iodine supplementation red algae supplementation ,0
 western montana ,0
 thank you medcram ,0
 they make a lot of sense ,0
 i hope to have some local city officials listening to this i am in silicon valley and just as we have done lock down together we could follow this idea as a bay area looking forward to this live ,0
 thank you for joining the q and a today here is a good recent article (august 3) summarizing some of dr mina s testing ideas https and www harvardmagazine com and 2020 and 08 and covid 19 test for public health ,0
 bonjour smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes ,0
 i feel like crap today a rapid test would be nice ,0
 still feel crappy ,0
 actually that did help ,0
 better than getting gassed out in a long line of cars too ,0
 maybe the current contact tracers should hand out the rapid tests (door to door) and give up on tracing ,0
 cnn today confused sensitivity for accuracy again someone (preferably dr mina) needs to get on there to set the record straight ,0
 i d like an appointment with our local weather lady ,0
 might just be delirious ,0
 pog champ ,0
 talk about making workplaces safer as a supplement to pcr tests also airplane cruise ship safety ,0
 it s great to see all you smart people watching this we need to all folks to get behind our contry moving forward back to school back to work ,0
 btw replace the batteries in your infrared thermometers ,0
 significant finding of bromhexine with hcq coming out of iran ,0
 they ll say it s a medical device i m sure the fda regulates pregnancy tests ,0
 fda approval would be recognised overseas as a valid medical product ,0
 the vote down seems to be a consistent and personal issue ,0
 at david smith i think a lot of products are just grandfathered and never directly approved ,0
 fda fools dictate aproval ,0
 i think it would need recognition as medical product for it to be adopted by governments overseas ,0
 covid1984 cornholio19 lol ,0
 thank you for actually starting a live event on time ,0
 several covid paper tests have received eua (fda emergency authorization) ,0
 people still talking about hqc lol ,0
 hqc shot down by nejm ,0
 pcr is not diagnostic ,0
 false negatives ,0
 at taher maazoun asymptomatics don t have symptoms so the answer is there are no 1st symptoms ,0
 governor hogan going to help jump start quick test ,0
 hoping to hear something about the manufacturing process ,0
 i think i read 3m is working on them ,0
 god it s so frustrating we have been testing the same way and it s not working ,0
 also political reasons ,0
 mask distance test daily trace and isolate ,0
 a quick test combo pack including a mask vitamin d and zinc would be nice ,0
 clea is the governmental body that regulates clinical labs ,0
 the antigen test is a ct value of around the low 30s ,0
 complaints in oregon from healthcare workers regarding pcr tests are running out of reagents ,0
 sounds like a company could get crafty with a legal team and workaround this ,0
 plandemic goofball ,0
 received wisdom dictated ventillators were the answer to covid19 received wisdom said corticosteroids shouldn t be used and it s simply received wisdom and habit dictating pcr over paper tests ,0
 ct 30 is more than enough for catching someone on the upward curve of infection ,0
 famotidine with celecoxib ,0
 yet again drowning in a sea of red tape ,0
 great chart should be the thumbnail for the video ,0
 here doctors aren t even waiting for pcr as it s too late by then ,0
 at david chadd i don t see the chart yet you are way ahead slightly smiling face ,0
 doesn t sound like it i heard he has started reaching out to to other countries bc usa has too much red tape frowning face ,0
 we need an apollo 13 approach to this i call it the 1 1 1 initiative a 1 minute low sensitivity test costing 1 buck and 1 drop of saliva ,0
 asymptomatic trans is likely 2 5 days maybe a week but the exponential growth is hours to peak ,0
 great examples can get the idea across to non scientists ,0
 we need local leadership to speak up to federal regulators ,0
 oh now feed went away ,0
 paper tests are being used for example in hospital ers a friend of mine recently broke his leg and got tested for covid in the er with results back in 15 min that had to be a paper test ,0
 we are struggling here in northern california with ridiculous tats making contact tracing embarrassing letting people know 7days later pcr ,0
 need to reach and convince the influencers ,0
 at lew that was likely a molecular test (abbot idnow) ,0
 1 to 2 ,0
 at m ball at scale 1 2 per test ,0
 define molecular test thanks ,0
 in algeria patients infected with covid19 mostly arrive late (a few days after the onset of symptoms)so for me the rapid test is the best choice ,0
 some sports teams use papers tests as do some private firms i could see increasing use migrating from the private sector but it needs a vast spotlight on it to speed things up ,0
 big pharma can t make billions off of it ,0
 way too expensive to sell ,0
 pcr not that effective here in india coz of constant mutations ,0
 skip fda and sell directly to more sensible countries ,0
 molecular tests detect genetic code like rt pcr ,0
 everyone is on their own too much money involved ,0
 i just use a moka pot on my stove pot slightly smiling face ,0
 at least usa gov is not working on a vaccine it s private corps ,0
 tired of hearing potential solutions and then it is months later and you hear nothing more ,0
 antibodies are only good for a certain length of time new bugs come old bugs change ,0
 solutions don t sell newspapers ,0
 k baltyn well put ,0
 matt not quite correct most vaccine development programs that are out ahead are funded by a public and private partnership companies have received billions of dollars from barda for example ,0
 at quentin baca cheers it could work well ,0
 at lew of course but it s not the gov directly just funding ,0
 barda is the government ,0
 that s wordy ,0
 maybe another country would be open to using this then the us would be more prone to listen and hopefully follow ,0
 this was mentioned on national news last night ,0
 look to dr mina s pre print ,0
 diabetic strips and machines are fairly expensive with out insurance i think they could develop a similar test but i think it would be cost prohibitive unfortunately ,0
 covid is a huge hoax every aspect of it is a fraud from the testing to the diagnosing the death rates it s all a means to usher in more controls ,0
 saliva tests are good ,0
 unfortunately it may need the crisis of increasing exponential growth to overcome the barriers ,0
 people die every day anyway ,0
 at linda nordahl india is starting to use antigen tests en masse but they don t have the understanding of nuances of test sensitivity ,0
 tanning machines for vitamin d production are not approved by the government somebody may get skin cancer in a hundred years ,0
 all it takes is a stroke of a president s pen to do away with the red tape and acronym named agencies ,0
 tim butler your very incorrect please apply common sense ,0
 dr mina please work with your colleagues at harvard and our other great medical institutions to send a formal report and request to all 50 governors offices fda and washington every major news network ,0
 go to the governors gov of maryland is a smart one ,0
 at chelsea shay diabetic kits are often subsidized such a coronav kit could and should also be ,0
 it s the flu even fauci wrote in the new england journal of medicine (not read by the public) that s it s basically the flu ,0
 contact your gov reps ,0
 at john waters oh i have common sense i connect the dots just like david icke and dr andrew kaufman do ,0
 so happy we have block function in this chat bye bye troll slightly smiling face ,0
 gov cuomo would probably get on board senator chris murphy and blumenthal would likely do so too ,0
 the tests are a fraud the virus hasn t even been proven to exist ,0
 masks are a symbol comrade that works some ,0
 at robert davies good idea ,0
 don t feed the troll ,0
 yes and so does the flu every year too wake up ,0
 block the troll ,0
 i m just blocking all maga trolls in the chat get ready for biden ,0
 you are a funny man tim ,0
 you want the truth people watch any of andrew kaufmans interviews ,0
 sengsatina right thumbs up ,0
 not trying to be funny john trying to bring light to this dark hoax ,0
 maga masked americans gain access ,0
 at tim butler dozens of people die every year from pop machines tipping over on them see covid is just like pop machines ,0
 at tim butler covid has killed 5 times more people in only 5 months than the flu did all year ,0
 oh that s brilliant jeremy way to use your critical thinking ,0
 meh don t feed the troll ,0
 golemuk yes ,0
 at tim butler cdc ,0
 at tim butler was just using your thinking ,0
 i hate this covid ,0
 the irony is these paper tests are desperately needed worldwide so any country that upscales production of them massively will benefit not only themselves but the world ,0
 at ray cross yes but costs 125 ,0
 but it made taught many experiences ,0
 in the beginning christine ,0
 but wtf ,0
 this could be used as prescreening just like police use uncertified portable breathalyzers as one indicator that someone may need testing on a certified breathalyzer ,0
 cdc was sending out test with cov19 at the start of this and got busted doing that out of atlanta ,0
 of course there s a lot of confusion about this because it s not real and the lies just continue ,0
 they are inexpensive comparatively inexpensive but availability is the question ,0
 the cdc test was an rtpcr and it was badly flawed had to be withdrawn and re worked in the meantime we could have been using proven rtpcr tests from foreign sources ,0
 yeah maybe price gouging due to low availability ,0
 it s not available because it isn t legal ,0
 everything about covid that s going on is fake ,0
 i second robert wagner s question ,0
 basically worthless to stop the spread as stated a home test with no machine would be needed ,0
 go makers yes ,0
 to his point the quidel test costs 160 per test in ma ,0
 need some biohackers to come up with a way to make one at home ,0

 at thekch2112 that is a free gift amen ,0
 it s mostly business ,0
 as a paramedic on the front line every patient i transfer has cv19 since the beginning of the year i hate all the droplet precautions and decon preventions i ve never taken risk with a maybe test ,0
 pretty much everyone is overweight and at risk ,0
 wear mask sanitise your hand every now and then maintain social distancing and u will be safe ,0
 trolling is posting controversial stuff just to annoy others and get a reaction ,0
 yes i m new to chats and ,0
 at michelle mcgarity wait for it ,0
 quidel test with sofia 2 analyzer costs about 23 but test kits are limited by production capacity and component availability probably could handle 400 tests and hr but need basic level staff ,0

 no problems solutions john lennon ,0
 to a point torp ,0
 well dr s deserves it for sure ,0
 one covid vaccine won t all that has to localised based on the nations genome ,0
 my sense of radx was to develope the expresso machine type of covids test not the type of test that dr mina is talking about ,0
 s korona its likely that one vaccice will do because it can work on parts of virus that dont change like the spike protein the phylogenetics analysis proves corona is slowly mutating ,0
 agreed we need 50 mil tests every day ,0
 green tea and zinc is a good way to boost your immune system green tea contains an ionophore that allows zinc to interfere with virus reproduction ,0
 working sensitivity not overall sensitivity ,0
 at life is good my parents were prefectly healthy covid caused them harm and a month long hospital stay they still have long term negative health effects months later ,0
 we need another word ,0
 watch the medcram videos then come back to the chat ,0
 simple and makes sense but unfortunately we will never hear about this again ,0
 it can harm weak immune meaning sick kids and old ,0
 at life is good both are 65 ,0
 labs are overrun ,0
 most of humanity is nutrient deficient in some way that is related to immunity ,0
 they got weak immune i believe ,0
 uk have a cartridge based test in development it should be sub 100 but it has to be upscaled and is not yet ready promising though ,0
 alex is correct ,0
 alex 7 wise words it would be so easy to fix vit d zinc etc ,0
 modern living and shopping at costco is not particularly healthy ,0
 at life is good i haven t caught it they live in nashville i live in hunsville al ,0

 trying to listen to the dr but gotta be honest it s really over my head he may as well be speaking gebrish y all have a good day stay healthy and be kind to others ,0
 i see the true answers popping up in the chat the answers are already here and it is not chasing after another test ,0
 you can also easily repeat a paper test so the benefits massively outway that small reductionin early capture ,0
 cf medcram 98 for virus particle numbers ,0
 so one little 3 person company is the only one with the correct test no chance ,0
 diabetic patients should be very careful ,0
 janis paynter the abbot test is being used widely in the us today dr minna is asking for a much much cheaper test that doesn t need a machine ,0
 this is ground breaking will make it possible to go back to school work etc take this inexpensive test every morning before heading out brilliant ,0
 thanks i should have made that clear ,0
 yes janis i would so like to go back to church ,0
 transmisi n starts before symptoms onset and by the time people get texted and get results they have already transmitted the virus to many other people ,0
 older people usually live with diabetes due to unhealthy lifestyle ,0
 hit thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up spread this like virus thumbs up ,0
 nah you spit on the paper ,0
 looked at in objective honesty this is a nothingburger a tiny percent of an insignificant species dies from a microbe meaningless humans are so narcissistic to think they should be immune ,0
 catches all of the people that are infectious just not the ones that have it but not enough to be infectous ,0
 so you have a new test you know you have the virus the doctor does wait and watch and you die you need proactive doctors with the known solutions ,0
 j holan the paper tests do not require a nasal swap just saliva ,0
 it makes no sense that someone w a high viral load dont have symptoms ,0
 phil porush ,0
 med is like the mil great people in the field and crap politician and selfsering and generals at the upper ,0
 spreaders are symptomatic ,0
 a nasal swap would make things worse ,0
 spreaders are not always symptomatic ,0
 that is the problem ,0
 only joe rogan can get tests he tests every single guest and himself every day ,0
 cf medcram 98 for an explanation of the graph ,0
 symptoms can present in obscure ways ,0
 its estimated that c 40 percent of spread is via pre and a symptomatic ppl your viral load is the highest just before the onset of symtoms and 3 days after the onset ,0
 just take malarial drug unless u really need life support ,0
 that would make it really cheap ,0
 i would love to see a flow chart explaining all of the tests ,0
 yea life and death stakes ,0
 budesonide is a steroid ,0
 steroids are not interchangeable ,0
 this is available in russia ,0
 i m not a big fan of pooled samples but okay sighhhhh ,0
 budesonide is used by millions of asthma patients ,0
 albuterol for asthma ,0
 some steroids are stronger have different specific effects than others ,0
 prednisone for asthma ,0
 check out math protocol dr maris professor at east virginia university ,0
 yeah pool testing ,0
 uvc only not uva uvb ,0
 great to finally see a world class instructor on medcram ,0
 life is good is proving it s not always ,0
 lateral assay immunofluorescent covid 19 rapid testing strips are available in russia they re in short supply but production is ramping up they cost about 70 rubles per strip ( 1 usd) ,0
 don t let potus know about paper test he d spruik it msm will predictably attack it claiming lack of sensitivity game over ,0
 lol dr s ,0
 everyone wants a degree of oversight to monitor the numbers nobody seems to like the idea of unmonitored testing but it may have to happen and unmonitored testing is still better than no testing ,0
 let s get this type of testing up and running so our countries can get back to some kind of normal get the dead and infection rate down ,0
 now gargling is recommended w povidone iodine ,0
 yes like i want you have somebody shove a swab into my head ,0
 use paper test along with app to video doc for record and authorization that could be shared with any organization that will not raise retail cost but still allow it to be regulated ,0
 xylitol is also known to lower respiratory infections (and cavities) ,0
 good point track and trace is not easy to do after all and is costly in skilled manpower and resources ,0
 reonptech such a valid point also ppl would oppose being tested just because they would feel that it violates their rights ,0
 no fixing this until nov 5 so just suck it up people ,0
 seems the census and sars are an untimely match ,0
 qc procedures can catch cheaters with statistical sampling at entry points but businesses and schools will have to deal with these issues by policies ,0
 there currently are no paper strips lateral flow immunoassays (bd and quidel antigen tests) and all home pregnancy tests use nitrocellulose membranes ,0
 seriously really appreciate dr mina coming on to medcram a wealth of information and presents a strategy for moving forward ,0

 repeat testing is a moneymaker ,0
 turn on the transcriptions ,0
 ironic that high frequency paper testing could be far more diagnotically useful than slow pcr ,0
 in other words wear a mask 24 and 7 and assume everybody is ill ,0
 ct values are not reported because often the machines dont give you the exact result just positive and begative ,0
 thank you for all this information and all the work you ve put into getting it out ,0
 yeah hes right timing is everything ,0
 good questions and comments thanks for taking the time ,0
 i hope everyone shares this video ,0
 this live stream will be available in full after the stream ,0
 sprad the word as far as i can see ,0
 at robnation i think the more prudent assumption is to assume that you re ill the mask is to protect other people ,0
 boost your immune system ,0
 we re learning so much that will be useful for the next pandemic ,0
 thx dr mina ,0
 i hope we look back in 6 months and credit this dr for trailblazing this methodology of testing for covid 19 i am glad he has the courage to speak out ,0
 the testing now is all for looks but people made lots of money from it ,0
 all of my co workers would send that to their senator ,0
 i carry hand senenizer ,0

 another thing we can do is mention this type of test on all the comment sections of major news stories to get people aware that such a thing exists ,0
 thank you so much kyle and michael as informative as always lets hope this gets done sooner rather than later ,0
 maybe he should advise the administration ,0
 seems like facebook s privacy violations affected many people s view of data collection etc bummer ,0
 good info thanks guys ,0
 good work looking forward to updates as this evolves ,0
 public health surveillance versus dx testing and the role of the fda is the message that needs to be out there ,0
 the fact that we have high infection but compared to the beginning we now have a much lower death rate ,0
 cuz they re scared of trump ,0
 copy the link and put it on fb and linkedin ,0
 antigen tests detect the proteins on the active virus you are talking about antibodies ,0

 at makai smith methylated vits can save your body steps and reduce the cofactors needed recommend scoping it out really comes into play with the b vits and folates ,0
 governments should support outdoor activities with isolation not forcing people to stay home infecting their entire household and weakening their immune system ,0

 thanks doc ,0
 ivermectin is at the top of the docking ability and this was back in march ,0
 csl released a statement re australian vaccine being halted ,0
 makai that s a very good point ,0
 yup lockdown causes immune suppression ,0
 research quercetin (anti viral) ,0
 at makai smith you will also see some other familiar drugs such as azithromycin (zpak) ,0
 l citrulline supplementation increases nitric oxide in blood ,0
 well obviously this ccp virus was designed to target specific demographics ,0
 of course ,0

 thank you doctor for this incredibly invaluable information it is much appreciated ,0
 vitamin k2 is important to take together with vitamin d to avoid hypercalcification ,0

 syncytin 1 being hit by antibodies worries me ,0
 at paula suciu people went from spending all day in office to all day in houses the lockdown didn t harm us ,0
 at springheelmac you can find nac in amazon store but you can find it too in pharmacies ,0
 at makai smith i believe antibody attacks placenta ,0
 very very strong correlation ,0
 california government has been clearly insane at time ,0
 dosing is the issue w ivermectin ,0
 i m very interested in your thoughts on ivermectin too ,0
 150 400 mcg per kg seems to be the current range for ivm ,0

 much of the research as mentioned comes out of finland because their saunas are traditional they re generally quite hot ,0
 as a rule most of the research has been on traditional james including the research just mentioned ,0
 walt that s within the high dose response range the effects of exercise and other positive lifestyle habits like sauna eating right are all cumulative one probably doesn t replace all others ,0
 creating a safe and controlled brief increase in body temperature with something like an infrared blanket has to have similar effects the challenge is that it changes all the dose aspects of duration ,0
 good morning to all from bridgetown barbados i love this topic smiling face with heart eyes ,0
 at blossom fire good morning thanks for tuning in from barbados ,0
 thanks for your clear explanations and all of the great work you do most informative ,0

 at normally norma breast er pr her2 luminol b high risk zero risk factors aside from emf ,0

 homeostatic response after sauna ,0
 i do cold showers after my sauna ,0
 there is my answer ,0
 thanks for dropping by and your kind remarks kentucky hiker ,0
 sweating is typically a very good thing ,0
 but the benefits from sauna and the more extreme temperatures go beyond just the sweating ,0
 love dr rhonda ,0
 a mild one ,0
 one of the videos that you will want to watch again ,0
 another was eat fast and live longer guy ,0
 at medcram medical lectures explained clearly thanks ,0
 my infrared sauna set at 140 degrees 30 minutes with red light therapy i wish i could use it at least 3x and week ,0
 the fins also have socialized medicine so that helps ,0
 the blood rushing internally to core with cold should be ok and only very shirt transient effect unless she has some head circulation issues but is likely all due to dehydration and low blood volume ,0
 love all your info been watching you for years rhonda and you are looking better than ever ,0
 norma i appreciate it thank you for watching ,0
 thank you medcram and kyle for having me on your evidence based discussions lectures and interviews are so beneficial to all of us ,0

 poppi weasel better than nothing especially since the average us home has 0 5 air changes per hour but of course would be better to have a air cleaner appropriately sized for room ,0
 airplanes all use compressed filtered air ,0
 covid propaganda channel ,0
 my current out door aqi is 38 ,0
 toriless agreed the air changes per hour on airplanes is actually quite good dr allen s team has helped changed airline protocols on this ,0
 more like the size of a can of pop ,0
 latest airplanes such as 787 has good humidifier ,0
 airplanes all use hepa filtration ,0
 that said during boarding and deplaning filtered air systems (through hepa filtration) may not be running although most airlines have improved on this since covid impacts began ,0

 this is stuff i did not know neat ,0
 wow 8 cm ,0
 we just had stores this year pull out half of the sunscreens becasue of teh increased risk for cancer ,0
 gotta get healthy and take better care of the skin in order to safely obtain sunlight though and sunscreen is unfortunately not going to help at all ,0
 and more efficiently create vitamin d as well ,0
 nir is interesting ,0
 very educational presentation very interesting watching from vienna austria ,0

 dr ott the full spectrum covers cool stuf about light penetration ,0
 at lydia maganan thanks for your kind feedback and tuning in from vienna ,0

 at npc i m knot the light trump was promoting was uv from tanning beds ,0
 sun melatonin nir(sun trees) vitd ,0
 i mean lasers ,0
 yea trump was right again lmao ,0
 yah ellen g white ,0
 dr seheult spoke about the uv light ages ago way before trump spoke about it ,0
 trump likes sunlight as much as he hates make up ,0
 uh oh (putting on jacket heading outside) ,0
 he just said it might not be linked to the vitamin d ,0
 light bulb i need to get some infrared lighting ,0
 it might be something else in the uv light ,0
 darker skin does not convert sunlight to vitamin d as effectively but everyone can achieve adequate levels with proper supplementation must be careful with uv light (uva) that can be carcinogenic ,0
 uv might be a disinfectant his exact words ,0
 it s obvious on top of this is that there is a huge waste using electricity with huge bad effect on climate disaster ,0
 someone suggested it to trump but he was far too dumb to explain it to the public ,0
 yeah at wiley schmitt ,0
 you need to tell this to dr campbell ,0
 climate disaster is one of the major factors in 1 destruction of natural habitat of beasts ,0
 wow sunlight with nir is so important ,0
 i live in australia it s way to hot outdoors the summer heat is debilitating ,0
 lol i m going outside and get disinfected ,0
 he saw it as an easy solution like injecting disinfectants ,0
 trump is a genius comared to senile joe ,0
 2 as the beasts move next door we become naiive hosts to evolved mutated vectors ,0
 yes but the ozone layer is gone so we get much more uva and carcinogenic rays than we did years ago ,0
 natural selection makes for more virulent vectors natural selection ,0

 at savar that s great you can be great developer with c plus plus gta pubg unreal engines all are coded with c plus plus never leave c plus plus if you want this path later you can use rust as well ,1
 bro tell me any good open source java startup if you know ,1
 at ankit if you re already using c plus plus continue if you re just starting use rust all modern low latency code use rust its improved and modern form of c plus plus thats it ,1
 at savar just start with coder army dsa playlist or code help by babbar dsa playlist if you know basic c plus plus very basic as you already told you can continue with their playlist they teach from start ,1
 at ankit around 15 minutes for fresh installation to configure you need around 30 minutes to download all packages and apps that you may need and configure neovim if you want it also need less time ,1
 at ankit yes you can wipe your drive and install only fedora or create partition and dual boot it have good wizard if you choose custom section ,1
 at hmmm not really i use thinkpad at my office if you know shortcuts it ll be easier to navigate ,1
 at subhrajyoti take gap only if you re confident you ll work hard enough to get in else no point wasting a year ,1
 this code is actually begginer friendly slightly intermediate i guess like if you are basically familiar with the syntax then you can understand a little bit ofc ,1

 at harkirat singh general advise if you re just starting to contribute to open source project ,1

 at ayushi choudhary if used just for coding 8gb is fine and you can always expand it later if you feel laggy ,1
 at raunak batra yeah its a good course if you want to learn mern ,1
 bhayia is it possible if you could release a blockchain course as well i will most likely buy that tbh ,1
 i have requested but i cannot run the project locally if you help me with that i can also try ,1
 at subham mukherjee good bro if you have backlogs that is your problem ,1
 at ghost monk if you want to go in web development then you will require python frameworks knowledge ,1
 at ghost monk if you want dive deep into any specific language you will require project experience and its totally depends upon you ,1
 its correct i think so if you can check your console ,1
 at harkirat singh if you started streaming slightly intermediate level prs i think that ll help a lot more people ,1
 brother is there any difference between java stack developer and full stack developer except the language obviously ,1
 difference between cohort 1 and 2 ,1
